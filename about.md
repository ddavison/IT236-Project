### About Daniel
I am an avid persuer of bettering myself philosophically, programmatically, and morally.  I have been fiddling with computers since I was 12 years old, and I have loved
every minute.  I started programming with Perl, then moved to C++.  In my Career Center class in High School, I had actually won several professional competitions with my C++ programming.

About 5-6 years ago, I started with website development, and I found great joy in creating user-facing material.  I had won 1<sup>st</sup> place in a regional Website Development competition,
and followed up at 7<sup>th</sup> place in a State competition.

I now work as a professional software engineer in test for ProQuest LLC, and found my favorite languages: Ruby and Java. (Ruby moreso)
